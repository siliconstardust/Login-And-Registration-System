# Login and Registration System

A simple login and registration system built using basic programming concepts and data structures.  
This project demonstrates user authentication logic without using any external APIs or frameworks.

## Features
- User registration with input validation
- Secure login using stored credentials
- Credential verification logic
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Menu-driven, user-friendly flow

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: C / C++ / Python (update as applicable)
- Concepts Used:
  - Strings
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops
  - Functions
  - Basic data structures
  - File handling (if used)

## How It Works
1. New users can register by providing valid credentials.
2. Registered credentials are stored locally.
3. Existing users can log in using verified credentials.
4. The system validates input and restricts unauthorized access.

## Purpose of the Project
This project was created as a **DSA mini project** to understand:
- Authentication logic
- Flow control and decision making
- Real-world application of basic data structures

## Future Improvements
- Password hashing
- Database integration
- Role-based authentication
- GUI or web-based interface
